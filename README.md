# LSTM_Stocks
We'll be building a Forecasting Model to predict the trend of a particular stock using Recurrent Neural Networks - LSTM. We will use an Adam Optimizer, Dropout Regularizer, and MSE Loss Function. Phase I of the story discusses the Exploratory Data Analysis on a given Stock using various Plot Functions including but not limited to SNS Plots, Scatter Plots, and Box Plots.
